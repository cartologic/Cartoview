# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What is Cartoview exactly? Is it a replacement for GeoNode?**
    
[Cartoview](https://cartoview.net/) is a [Geo App market](https://appstore.cartoview.net/) for GeoNode. It is not a fork / improvement / reprlacement of GeoNode, but rather additional code aimed to make it more extensible to integrate third party apps directly from the browser.

**2. What are the goals of Cartoview?**

- Sharing GIS Apps.
- Provide apps for common tasks like visualizing and querying feature services.
- Extend the functions of the GeoNode SDI beyond data management.
- Provide a solid core of utilities that can be used to help developers integrate and deploy their Geo apps.
- Foster an ecosystem of apps extending easily deplyable and installable.

There is no reason for Cartoview not to work on this deployment. (This was never tested). Apps relying on GeoServer of course will not work.
