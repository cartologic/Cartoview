# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What is Cartoview exactly? Is it a replacement for GeoNode?**
    
Cartoview is a [Geo App market][1] for GeoNode. It is not a fork / improvement / reprlacement of Geonode, but rather additional code aimed to make it more extensible to integrate third party apps directly from the browser.
