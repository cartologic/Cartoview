# Cartoview Core Installation | Windows

## Introduction

This guide describes how to install and configure a fresh setup of Cartoview to run it in DEBUG mode (also known as DEVELOPMENT mode) on **Windows 10** 64-bit clean environment.

This part of the documentation describes installation of **Cartoview-1.33.0** which comes with **GeoNode-3.3.0** and **GeoServer-2.19.x**.

!!! warning
    Those guides are not meant to be used on a production system. Instead, you can follow the [Docker](docker.md) guide.

!!! note
    The following steps will use shell commands that you must enter on a local terminal (e.g. CMD, Powershell, etc.).

If you plan to customize Cartoview & GeoNode user interface components to your needs, it's recommended to use [Cartoview Windows Installer](https://cartoview.net/download/). Check the available Windows installer [guide](windows-installer.md).

## Installation Requirements

### Python Setup

Download and install [Python-3.8.10 32-bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.10/python-3.8.10.exe).

Make sure to check the option `Add Python 3.8 to PATH` so that we can use it inside the local terminal.

!!! note
    If Python is not added to PATH, check this tutorial regarding [How to add Python to Windows PATH](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/).

![Python](../img/installation/Windows/install_python.png "Python-3.8.10 32-bit")

After installing, open your local terminal (e.g. CMD) and execute the following command to make sure python is installed and added to PATH correctly.

```shell
# Should print Python 3.8.10
python --version
```

### Create a Python Virtual Environment

Make sure **virtualenv** is installed by executing:
```shell
# Should print virtualenv 20.10.0
virtualenv --version
```

!!! note
    If **virtualenv** is not installed, install it with `pip install virtualenv`.

Create a folder in the directory at which you want to install Cartoview and Let's name it ``cartoview_service`` (You can name it whatever you want).

Inside ``cartoview_service`` folder, open your local terminal (e.g. CMD).

Create a virtual environment and call it ``cartoview_venv``.
```shell
virtualenv cartoview_venv
```
    
Now after creating the virtual environment, activate it so that it can be used.
```shell
.\cartoview_venv\Scripts\activate
```

!!! note
    You would notice how your prompt is now prefixed with the name of the virtual environment, ``cartoview_venv`` in our case. This indicates that your virtualenv is active.

Each upcoming command must be executed while the virtual environment is activated.

### GDAL Installation

**GDAL** can be installed through [OSGeo4W](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). But this time we need to install it manually inside our virtual environment.

Download GDAL‑3.2.3‑cp38‑cp38‑win32 wheel file from the [Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal).

Install downloaded GDAL wheel file with `pip` in the virtual environment.
```shell
pip install GDAL-3.2.3-cp38-cp38-win32.whl
```

![Install GDAL](../img/installation/Windows/install_gdal.png "GDAL‑3.2.3 Installation")

---

## Database Installation

In this section we are going to install **PostgreSQL** database along with the **PostGIS** extension which is a spatial database extender for PostgreSQL. It adds support for geographic objects allowing location queries to be run in SQL.

### Install PostgreSQL 13

Download PostgreSQL Windows installer certified by EnterpriseDB from [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). We will use version **13.5**.

Open the downloaded executable file and proceed with the installation.

Choose the components that you want to be installed in your system. It's recommended to leave it as default.

![PostgreSQL Components](../img/installation/Windows/postgres/postgres1.png "PostgreSQL Components")

!!! note
    This will install [**pgAdmin4**](https://www.pgadmin.org/) which is a GUI management tool for PostgreSQL database.

Enter a superuser password. This is the one by which you will access all your databases including what we will create next, so please save it.

![PostgreSQL Password](../img/installation/Windows/postgres/postgres2.png "PostgreSQL Password")

Leave everything as default and continue.

Before click on **Finish**, make sure to leave the check on for the **stack builder** to start it after finishing.

Select ``PostgreSQL 13 (x64) on port 5432``.

![Stack Builder](../img/installation/Windows/postgres/postgres3.png "Stack Builder")

Install PostGIS-3.1 and select ``Next`` to download all the required files.

![PostGIS-3.1](../img/installation/Windows/postgres/postgres4.png "PostGIS-3.1")

Select PostGIS. Click **Ok** for any prompt appears.

![PostGIS-3.1](../img/installation/Windows/postgres/postgres5.png "PostGIS-3.1")

Now PostgreSQL database is successfully installed and running.

### Access PostgreSQL 

#### Using Terminal
We can access PostgreSQL through command prompt, but first we need to add the **bin** directory of PostgreSQL to PATH system variable.

![Add PostgreSQL to Path](../img/installation/Windows/postgres/add-path.png "Add PostgreSQL to Path")

Open a CMD terminal and connect to the database with user **postgres** with the password that you set during the installation.

![Connect with CMD](../img/installation/Windows/postgres/access-terminal.png "Connect with CMD")

#### Using pgAdmin4

In the search bar (beside windows icon), search for ``pgAdmin4`` application and run it.

Set the master password that should be used each time you open pgAdmin4.

![Set Master Password](../img/installation/Windows/pgAdmin/set-password.png "Set Master Password")

Navigate to left panel, under **Servers** dropdown, **right-click** and create a new server, we will name it **Local PostgreSQL-13**.

![Create PostgreSQL Server](../img/installation/Windows/pgAdmin/new-server-1.png "Create PostgreSQL Server")

Add the server information including the password that you set during the installation.

![Create PostgreSQL Server](../img/installation/Windows/pgAdmin/new-server-2.png "Create PostgreSQL Server")

Click **Save**. Now the installed PostgreSQL server is connected successfully to pgAdmin4.

You can now access PostgreSQL dashboard inside pgAdmin4.

![pgAdmin4 Dashboard](../img/installation/Windows/pgAdmin/pgAdmin-dashboard.png "pgAdmin4 Dashboard")

!!! note
    You may notice that there's an already created database called ``postgres`` that will be used to create Cartoview databases.

---

## Database Configuration

In this section we are going to configure PostgreSQL to create and connect to Cartoview databases.

### Update Access Policies for local connections

Update access policies for local connections in the file **pg_hba.conf** available at `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13\data` to be able to connect to the database without password.

```
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
# local   all             all                                     peer
local   all             all                                     trust
```

Restart PostgreSQL to make the change effective.

In the search bar (beside windows icon), search for Services and open it then navigate until you find **postgresql-x64-13** and restart it.

![Restart PostgreSQL](../img/installation/Windows/postgres/restart-postgres.png "Restart PostgreSQL")

### Create Cartoview Databases

Create two new databases ``cartoview`` and ``cartoview_datastore``.

You can create the databases using one of two approaches, through CMD terminal with [SQL commands](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-commands.html) or using pgAdmin4 GUI.

#### SQL Commands with CMD

Open a CMD terminal and open **psql** command line.

```shell
# Open psql command line
psql -U postgres
```

```shell
# Create database named as cartoview and cartoview_datastore
CREATE DATABASE cartoview;
CREATE DATABASE cartoview_datastore;
```

Add PostGIS extension to the created databases to deal with the geographic objects.

For **cartoview** database:

```shell
# To be executed at CMD terminal
psql cartoview -U postgres

# To be executed at psql terminal
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

Exit the PostgreSQL terminal with ``\q``

For **cartoview_datastore** database:

```shell
# To be executed at CMD terminal
psql cartoview_datastore -U postgres

# To be executed at psql terminal
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

!!! note
    The previous step must be done for the two databases, **cartoview** and **cartoview_datastore**.

#### Using pgAdmin4 GUI

Open pgAdmin4 and under **Local PostgreSQL-13** tree, right-click and select **Create** >> **Database**.

![Create Database](../img/installation/Windows/pgAdmin/create-database.png "Create Database")

You will be prompted a pop-up to enter information about the database like the name and template.

Under **General** tab, set the name of the database to **cartoview** and under **Definition** tab, set the template to **template0**.

![Database Name](../img/installation/Windows/pgAdmin/database-name.png "Database Name")

Add ``postgis`` extension to the created database **cartoview**.

![Add PostGIS Extension](../img/installation/Windows/pgAdmin/add-extension.png "Add PostGIS Extension")

Repeat the previous steps to create the second database, **cartoview_datastore**.

---

## Cartoview Installation

As Cartoview is build on top of GeoNode, we need to install GeoNode first.

### Install GeoNode

Navigate inside ``cartoview_service`` directory and make sure ``cartoview_venv`` is still activated. 

Clone [GeoNode-3.3.0](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/tree/3.3.0) from GitHub.

```shell
git clone -b 3.3.0 https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode.git
```

Edit `requirement.txt` and `setup.cfg` files commenting the **production** and **test** packages as they are not compatible with Windows environment.

Install GeoNode packages.
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade --no-cache --no-cache-dir
pip install -e .
```

### Install Cartoview

Download Cartoview 1.33.0 version by cloning the repository and checkout the release tag.
```shell
git clone -b v1.33.0 https://github.com/cartologic/cartoview.git
```

This will create a folder called ``cartoview`` inside ``cartoview_service``.

Navigate to ``cartoview`` directory and install cartoview dependencies.

```shell
cd cartoview
pip install -e .
```

### Add Cartoview Environment Variables
Cartoview requires adding some environment variables while running it or executing commands through terminal.

It's recommended to use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) which is a powerful python IDE that has a lot of features to offer.

Create a new PyCharm configuration and add the following environment variables accordingly.
![PyCharm Configuration](../img/installation/Windows/pycharm/env-settings.png "PyCharm Configuration")

```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgis://postgres:postgis@localhost:5432/cartoview

DATASTORE_DATABASE_URL=postgis://postgres:postgis@localhost:5432/cartoview_datastore

ALLOWED_HOSTS=['*']

DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=cartoview.settings

DEFAULT_BACKEND_UPLOADER=geonode.importer
```

![PyCharm Configuration](../img/installation/Windows/pycharm/env-variables.png "PyCharm Environment Variables")

It's required to add them also to the terminal configuration.
![PyCharm Configuration](../img/installation/Windows/pycharm/terminal-settings.png "Terminal Environment Variables")

But the following variables only.
```shell
DATABASE_URL=postgis://postgres:postgis@localhost:5432/cartoview

DATASTORE_DATABASE_URL=postgis://postgres:postgis@localhost:5432/cartoview_datastore

ALLOWED_HOSTS=['*']
```

!!! note
    This means that you must ONLY use Pycharm terminal in order for everything to work properly. To be able to use CMD, add the environment variables mentioned above to Windows by following [this guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml4r/1.5.1/oread/creating-and-modifying-environment-variables-on-windows.html).

#### Import GDAL Library
As we have installed GDAL before, we need to import the location of its libraries into Cartoview settings.

Navigate to `cartoview\cartoview\`, create a file there called **pre_settings.py**, and add the following content.

```python
import os
from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib


if os.name == 'nt':
    os.environ['Path'] = (r'%s\osgeo;' % (get_python_lib())) + os.environ['Path']
    os.environ['GEOS_LIBRARY_PATH'] = (r'%s\osgeo\geos_c.dll' % (get_python_lib()))
    os.environ['GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH'] = (r'%s\osgeo\gdal302.dll' % (get_python_lib()))
```

Import this file in `cartoview\cartoview\settings.py` to be before GeoNode settings.

```python
...
from cartoview.pre_settings import *
from geonode.settings import *  # noqa
...
```

Import it also in `cartoview\pavement.py`.

As Django-2.2.20 [doesn't support GDAL >= 3.0](https://github.com/django/django/blob/2.2.20/docs/ref/contrib/gis/install/geolibs.txt#L13), we need to add the installed GDAL version inside django.

Navigate to django package in the virtual environment `site-packages` and modify the Django GDAL package python file **libgdal.py** available at `\path\to\cartoview_service\Lib\site-packages\django\contrib\gis\gdal\libgdal.py` according to the following.
```python
# Replace this line
lib_names = ['gdal203', 'gdal202', 'gdal201', 'gdal20', 'gdal111']
# With this line
lib_names = ['gdal302', 'gdal203', 'gdal202', 'gdal201', 'gdal20', 'gdal111']
```

To make sure everything is working properly, open Pycharm terminal and make sure the `cartoview_service` virtual environment is activated, and run the following command.
```shell
python manage.py check
```

Should print something like this:
![Check Project](../img/installation/Windows/pycharm/terminal-check.png "Check project configuration")

### Migrate & Load default data

Inside ``cartoview`` folder, run the below commands to migrate and load Cartoview data.

!!! warning
    - Make sure the virtual environment is still activated (If you see its name prefixed your prompt, you're good to go).
    - Make sure to add the above environment variables to the terminal so that the following commands run smoothly.

Detect changes in the ``app_manager``.
```shell
python manage.py makemigrations app_manager
```

Migrate the data.
```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Create accounts table.
```shell
python manage.py migrate account
```

Load default User.
```shell
python manage.py loaddata sample_admin.json
```

Load default oauth apps so that you will be able to authenticate with defined external server.
```shell
python manage.py loaddata default_oauth_apps.json
```

Load default Initial Data for Cartoivew.
```shell
python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json
```

Load default Cartoview Appstore data.
```shell
python manage.py loaddata app_stores.json
```

Collect static files.
```shell
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

#### Test Development Server
Check if Cartoview is working as expected.
```shell
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

Open a browser and check if cartoview is running at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).

![Cartoview website](../img/installation/Ubuntu/cartoview.png "Cartoview")

You should be able to successfully log with the default admin user (admin / admin) and start using it right away.

Now we have Cartoview up and running. The last thing we need to do, is to install and configure GeoServer.

---

## GeoServer Installation

Cartoview comes with a pre-configured GeoServer available by GeoNode. So it can be installed with [Paver](https://pythonhosted.org/Paver/) commands.

If you check the `pavement.py` file, you can see multiple created tasks like, `setup_geoserver`, `start_geoserver`, and `stop_geoserver`.

### Install Java and OpenJDK
As GeoServer is built with [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp), we need to install it alongside [Java SE Development Kit 8u311](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8-windows) the **jdk-8u311-windows-x64.exe**, specifically.

After installing both, open Pycharm terminal and make sure they are installed.

!!! note
    You may need to restart Pycharm after installing Java.

```shell
java -version
```

### Setup GeoServer
!!! warning
    - Make sure the virtual environment is still activated (If you see its name prefixed your prompt, you're good to go).
    - Make sure to import `cartoview\pre_settings.py` to `pavement.py`.


Run the task called `setup_geoserver` to download a customized version of GeoServer WAR file (provided by GeoNode) and setup [jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/).

!!! note
    - Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. It's used to host GeoServer.
    - The file called `dev_config.yml` holds the download URL for GeoServer and Jetty.

```shell
paver setup_geoserver
```

This will create two folders, the first one called `downloaded`, it contains the downloaded required files and `geoserver` which contains all the files related to GeoServer.

### Start GeoServer
Run the task called `start_geoserver` to launch jetty on port `8080` and start GeoServer.

!!! warning
    Make sure nothing is running on port `8080`.

```shell
paver start_geoserver
```

![GeoServer Logs](../img/installation/Windows/start-geoserver.png "GeoServer Logs")

GeoServer is now available and running at [http://localhost:8080/geoserver/](http://localhost:8080/geoserver/).
![GeoServer](../img/installation/Ubuntu/geoserver.png "GeoServer")

Make sure you're logged in with **admin/admin** in Cartoview at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) then navigate to 
[http://localhost:8080/geoserver/](http://localhost:8080/geoserver/) and click on the GeoNode button to use the pre-configured authentication between GeoNode and GeoServer.
![GeoServer Login](../img/installation/Ubuntu/geoserver-login.png "GeoServer Login")

!!! note
    You can also log in with the default GeoServer credentials admin/geoserver, but using GeoNode button is easier.

You can change the **admin** password by navigating to Security > Users, Groups, and Roles. Select `Users/Groups` tab, select `admin` user, and you can now update the password as you want. 
![Change GeoServer Password](../img/installation/Ubuntu/geoserver-password.png "Change GeoServer Login")

### Stop GeoServer
GeoServer can be stopped by running the task `stop_geoserver`.

```shell
paver stop_geoserver
```

!!! note
    When GeoServer is stopped, the jetty server got down also but all the uploaded data (e.g. layers) is saved in the folder called `geoserver` in cartoview directory.

---

## Post-Installation Notes

Congratulations! Cartoview is now installed successfully.

You can upload layers, create maps, and install Cartoview apps to visualize these maps.

!!! note
    If you got an error like the following message while uploading a layer, make sure to remove the **PROJ_LIB** environment variable from Windows system environment variables.
    `RuntimeError: PROJ: proj_identify: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13\share\contrib\postgis-3.1\proj\proj.db lacks DATABASE.LAYOUT.VERSION.MAJOR / DATABASE.LAYOUT.VERSION.MINOR metadata. It comes from another PROJ installation.`

Once Cartoview is installed, You can navigate to [http://localhost:8000/apps/](http://localhost:8000/apps/) to check and install all available apps from the [App Store](https://appstore.cartoview.net/).

After installing any app, you may need to restart the running django server if you can't see your app in `/apps`.
