## Create and Add your django app to Cartoview

***

Create a new empty app from **Cartoview App template** as below in your Cartoview project directory.

```shell
cd cartoview_project/apps
django-admin.py startapp --template=https://github.com/cartologic/Cartoview-app-template/archive/master.zip <app_name>
```

Edit ``cartoview_project/apps/apps.json`` and add an entry for your app. If you can't find `apps.json`, create it and add the following lines:

```json
{
    "app_name": {
        "active": true,
        "order": 1,
        "pending": false
    },
}
```

Add stores using the following command inside Cartoview project directory.

```shell
python manage.py loaddata app_stores.json
```

Add the new app to the database using the admin interface at `/admin`.
